# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Objective:
Create an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay ana add a third map style as an additional tile layer to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.

### Methods Used:
- Data Visualization 
- Mapping 
- USGS.gov earthquake data 

### Technologies:
- JavaScript
- D3
- Leaflet 
- HTML
- CSS
- MapBox
- GeoJSON

## Project Description 
I've made an API call to the tectonic plate data using d3.json(), and then added the data as an overlay to the map using the L.geoJSON() layer. In addition to the streets and satelliteStreets maps, I added a third map style of your choosing. All map styles were added to the base layer so that they show up on the map to allow the user to change which layers are visible.
