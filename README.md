# Mapping_Earthquakes

The illustration of the severity of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates.

I've made an API call to the tectonic plate data using d3.json(), and then added the data as an overlay to the map using the L.geoJSON() layer. In addition to the streets and satelliteStreets maps, I added a third map style of your choosing. All map styles werew added to the base layer so that they show up on the map to allow the user to change which layers are visible.
